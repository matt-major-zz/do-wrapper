[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/do-wrapper.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/do-wrapper)

### Install

```do-wrapper``` is available on ```npm``` and as such, can be installed through ```npm``` with ease.

To install ```do-wrapper``` and add it to your ```package.json``` file, use the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --save do-wrapper
```

### Documentation
All methods are documented. You can generate the API docs using the following command.

```sh
$ npm run doc
```

You can then open `doc/index.html` to view the API documentation.

Alternatively, you can view the generated markdown docs here:
* [Digital Ocean](docs/do-wrapper.md)
* [Request Helper](docs/request-helper.md)

### Usage

In order to use ```do-wrapper``` you will need to generate an API key on the DigitalOcean website. Once you have this, add the library to your project with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --save do-wrapper
```

Once installed you need to instantiate a new copy of ```do-wrapper``` in your application, like so:

```js
var DigitalOcean = require('do-wrapper'),
    api = new DigitalOcean('[api_key]', [page_size]);
```
*Note: replace [api_key] and [per_page_size] with your API key and desired page size.*

You can now test that your API key is correct and that everything is working by checking for your account information:
```js
api.account(function (err, res, body) {
  console.log(body);
});
```

Or, if you prefer promises:

```js
api.account().then(function (data) {
  console.log(data.body);
});
```

If you get back a response similar to the below, success!

```json
{
  "account": {
    "droplet_limit": 5,
    "email": "do-wrapper@do-wrapper.com",
    "uuid": "57e96b88ed1511e490ec1681e6b88ec1",
    "email_verified": true
  }
}
```

*Note: I've replaced my actual information with some dummy values...*
